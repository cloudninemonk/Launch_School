"""
Alyssa was asked to write an implementation of a rolling buffer. You can add and
remove elements from a rolling buffer. However, once the buffer becomes full,
any new elements will displace the oldest elements in the buffer.

She wrote two implementations of the code for adding elements to the buffer:

def add_to_rolling_buffer1(buffer, max_buffer_size, new_element):
    buffer.append(new_element)
    if len(buffer) > max_buffer_size:
        buffer.pop(0)
    return buffer

def add_to_rolling_buffer2(buffer, max_buffer_size, new_element):
    buffer = buffer + [new_element]
    if len(buffer) > max_buffer_size:
        buffer.pop(0)
    return buffer

What is the key difference between these implementations?

# ==========
# My Solution
# ==========

# The first implementation is performing mutating buffer, whereas the second
# implementation is reassigning buffer through augmentation.

# ==========
# LS Solution
# ==========

# Yes, there is a difference. The first function (add_to_rolling_buffer1)
# mutates the original list represented by buffer. The second function
# (add_to_rolling_buffer2) does not mutate the original list, but instead
# creates a new list and assigns it to buffer, whose value ultimately gets
# returned by the function.

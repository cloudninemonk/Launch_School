### 🧠 **1. Active Note-Taking (During Study)**

**Tool Suggestion:** Notion, Obsidian, or plain markdown files.

- **Split each topic** into:
    
    - _Concept summary_: what it is and why it matters.
    - _Code examples_: include _working_, _broken_, and _modified_ versions.
    - _Edge cases or caveats_: common pitfalls, gotchas, or best practices.

### 📇 **2. Make Flashcards (After Study)**
**Tool Suggestion:** Anki or RemNote

- Convert concepts, syntax, and edge cases into Q&A.
- Stick to **1 concept per card**.
- Use **cloze deletion** or fill-in-the-blank for memory.

✅ Example:
> Q: What does the `not` operator do in Python?  
> A: It inverts the truth value (True → False, False → True).

> Cloze Example:  
> `{{c1::not}} True` → False

### 🧪 **3. Practice with Problems**
**Tool Suggestion:** [LeetCode Easy], [Exercism], [Advent of Code], [Codewars]

- For every topic, solve **3–5 problems**:
  - Basic → Variations → Slightly harder
- After solving, write:
  - What you tried
  - What worked
  - What didn’t and why

✅ Workflow:
- Read prompt → Write pseudo-code → Code → Debug → Reflect

### 🔁 **4. Weekly Review**
Set aside a review day:
- Re-read notes.
- Review flashcards (Anki does this for you).
- Redo 1–2 past problems without looking at your solution.
- Try explaining a concept to yourself or someone else (rubber duck debugging).

---

### 🧩 **5. Monthly Project Sprint**
Build a **small project** every 2–4 weeks to apply what you’re learning:
- Calculator
- CLI tool
- Mini-game
- API fetcher
- To-do app

Even if rough, **shipping something** will clarify where your gaps are.

---

### Bonus Tools:
- **ChatGPT**: Use for code review, refactoring, clarifying confusing behavior.
- **GitHub Gists or Replit**: To save runnable code snippets.
- **VS Code with Jupyter or Markdown**: Good for executable note-taking.

Would you like me to create a Notion template or Anki deck template to get you started?

# What is PEDAC?

PEDAC stands for “[Understand the] **P**roblem, **E**xamples / Test Cases, **D**ata Structure, **A**lgorithm, and **C**ode.” PEDAC has two primary objectives: **process the problem** (PEDA) and **code with intent** (C).

#### PEDAC
| Objective | Step | Description|
| :--- | :---  | :-----      |
| Process the Problem | Understand the Problem | <ul><li>Identify expected input and output</li><li>Make the requirements explicit</li><li>Identify rules</li><li>Mental model of the problem (optional)</li></ul> |
| | Examples/Test Case | Validate understanding of the problem |
| | Data Structure | How we represent data that we will work with when converting the input to output. |
| | Algorithm | Steps for converting input to output |
| Code with Intent | Code | Implementation of Algorithm |

Processing the problem consists of 4 steps that lead you from the initial problem statement to a solid understanding of what is required. The result is the **Algorithm**, which you will use to implement the solution.

Once you have understood the problem, chosen an appropriate data structure, and have an algorithm to approach the problem, all you need to do is convert the algorithm into the programming language of your choice. We call this final step _coding with intent_, and the final result is the **implementation**.

# 🐍 Python Virtual Environments

## 📌 Why Use Virtual Environments?

- Isolate project dependencies.
- Prevent library version conflicts between projects.
- Keep development environment clean and portable.
- Enable consistent setups across machines.
- Support new Python versions (e.g., 3.12+).

---

## ⚠️ Version Notes

- Recommended Python versions: `3.9`, `3.11`.
- Flask versions: `2.3.1`, `2.1.2`.
- Deprecation warnings can be ignored for learning purposes.
- If `python@3.9` is unavailable via Homebrew, use another version.

---

## 📄 Example Programs

### `a.py` (Python 3.9)

```python
import sys

print(f"This is program {__file__}")
print(f"The Python version is {sys.version}")
```

### `b.py` (Python 3.11 + Flask 2.3.1)

```python
import sys
import flask

print(f"This is program {__file__}")
print(f"The Python version is {sys.version}")
print(f"The Flask version is {flask.__version__}")
```

### `c.py` (Python 3.11 + Flask 2.1.2)

```python
import sys
import flask

print(f"This is program {__file__}")
print(f"The Python version is {sys.version}")
print(f"The Flask version is {flask.__version__}")
```

## 🧠 Problem Without Virtual Environments

- Constantly switching Python/Flask versions is error-prone and tedious.
- Modifying the `PATH` manually is not practical.

---

## ✅ Solution: Virtual Environments

- Automatically handle environment variables like `PATH`.
- Each project gets its own isolated environment.

## 🛠️ Setting Up Virtual Environments

### 📁 Step 1: Create a Central Directory

```bash
mkdir ~/.venv
```

### 🐍 Step 2: Create Virtual Environments

```bash
python3.9 -m venv ~/.venv/env_a
python3.11 -m venv ~/.venv/env_b
python3.11 -m venv ~/.venv/env_c
```

### ⚙️ Step 3: Activate & Install Packages

```bash
source ~/.venv/env_a/bin/activate
pip install flask==<version>
deactivate
```

> Refer to the Python book for help with installing specific Python versions.

---

## 🚀 Running Applications

### `env_a`

```bash
source ~/.venv/env_a/bin/activate
python a.py
deactivate
```

### `env_b`

```bash
source ~/.venv/env_b/bin/activate
python b.py
deactivate
```

### `env_c`

```bash
source ~/.venv/env_c/bin/activate
python c.py
deactivate
```

> Shell scripts can automate activation/execution, but are beyond the current scope.

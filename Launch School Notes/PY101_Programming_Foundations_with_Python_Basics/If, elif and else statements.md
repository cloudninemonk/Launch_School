Yes, `elif` and `else` are considered statements in Python. They are part of the control flow syntax used in conjunction with the `if` statement to form a complete conditional structure. Specifically:

- `if` is the primary statement that starts a conditional block.
- `elif` (short for "else if") is a statement that provides an additional condition to check if the preceding `if` or `elif` condition evaluates to `False`.
- `else` is a statement that defines a block of code to execute if none of the preceding `if` or `elif` conditions are `True`.

Together, `if`, `elif`, and `else` form a compound statement structure for handling conditional logic. Here's an example:

```python
x = 10
if x > 0:
    print("Positive")
elif x == 0:
    print("Zero")
else:
    print("Negative")
```

In this example, `if`, `elif`, and `else` are all statements that control the flow of execution.

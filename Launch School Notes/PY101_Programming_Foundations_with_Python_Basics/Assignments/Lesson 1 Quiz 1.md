# **Primitive Data Types**
#primitive_data_types

- Primitive data types refer to the most basic, foundational data types provided by a language. Types that are not built from other types. In Python, **primitive data types** are the most basic built-in types that serve as the building blocks for data manipulation.
- 
✅ **Common Primitive Data Types in Python:**

1. `int` – Integer numbers  
   → Example: `5`, `-12`, `0`

2. `float` – Floating-point (decimal) numbers  
   → Example: `3.14`, `-0.5`

3. `bool` – Boolean values  
   → Example: `True`, `False`

4. `str` – Strings (text)  
   → Example: `"hello"`, `'A'`

5. `NoneType` – Represents the absence of a value  
   → Example: `None`

These types are considered "primitive" because they are:

- **Built into the language**
    
- **Immutable**
    
- **Directly represent values**, not complex structures

# Statements and Expressions
#statements #expressions
Be mindful that statements often contain expressions. 
For x = 3:
- This is a statement as the assignment '=' is performing an action of assigning the variable x to the int literal 3
- '3' is an expression that evaluates to 3

🔍 **Examples of expressions:**

- `3` → evaluates to `3`
- `'hello'` → evaluates to `'hello'`
- `x + 2` → evaluates to a value based on `x`
- `len('abc')` → evaluates to `3`


# Lesson 1 Quiz 1

You're about to take the first quiz in the Core Curriculum. Almost every lesson in Core concludes with one or two quizzes. Before you take one, take some time to look over our [Quiz Guide](https://launchschool.com/gists/9376eab7).

Pay particular attention to the fact that the quizzes are difficult, and that low scores are commonplace. Don't let a low score leave you feeling frustrated or demoralized. The quizzes are intended to highlight concepts that you might need to review, but they are not used in any way to evaluate your performance. Use the questions you missed to focus your attention on topics where you might need a bit more study.

Convert the string 'confetti floating everywhere' to all upper case.

# My response:

text = 'confetti floating everywhere'

print(text.upper()) # CONFETTI FLOATING EVERYWHERE

One small suggestion would be to store the uppercase result in a variable before printing it, 
as shown in the example solution. This approach can be helpful in more complex programs where 
you might need to use the transformed string multiple times. For example:

text = 'confetti floating everywhere'
uppercase_text = text.upper()
print(uppercase_text)  # CONFETTI FLOATING EVERYWHERE

What will the following code do and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

if True:
    my_value = 20

print(my_value)

# My response:

"""

# It will print 20 as 20 is truthy.

"""

My answer correctly identifies that the code will output "20", but there seems to be a misunderstanding about why this happens. 
You mentioned that "20 is truthy" - while it's true that 20 is a truthy value in Python, that's not why the code prints 20.

The if condition is simply True, so the code inside the block will always execute. The key concept being tested is that 
variables defined inside conditional blocks in Python are accessible outside those blocks - they don't have block scope 
like in some other languages.
